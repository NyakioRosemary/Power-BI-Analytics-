# Comparative Analysis 

### Objective 
Create an interactive Dashboard displaying comparison between Sales vs Budgeted Sales and
Current Year Sales vs previous Year Sales.

### Dashboard Image 
This is the view of our dashboard. Using 7 years data from 2014-2016. We created a dashboard that is interactive and filters by Category or  Product depending on budget Variance and Sales.
We also have a forecast Sales Trend in the next year 2021 predicting next years sales using the current Year, Previous Year and Budgeted Sales.

Based on the selected year we get to see that years current years sales (in this case 2019), the Budget Sales of that year, budget Sales from our projected budget, then previous year sales (in our case 2018) last thing is Sales Growth depending on current and previous year.

### Analysis Observation
From the observation 2019 made the highest sales of 888 M
with a budget sale of 853M and a budget variance of 4% from a previous year sale of 678M.
Category 3 is making the highest profits with a percentage of 36% product 12 making the highest sales. 
High budget allocation does not mean you will get high sales. Example December have the highest budget revenue but it has no profits in current year unlike March which has the ,low allocation budget but the sales are high. 

### Recommendation 
March seems to be making high sales look into what was happening.
Balance allocation budget
